CellBuster - a framework for single-cell raw data retrieval and reprocessing
============================================================================

Do you want to reanalyze some previous single-cell data? Is the data in a database
that requires a weird download tool? Is the data in an inconsistent format? Who do you call.......?

==Supported databases==

* EBI ArrayExpress
* EBI GXA
* GEO
* SRA
* HCA  --- soon!

==Installation==

Note that you need to configure sra toolkit before you can download any files from SRA.
This is done with the command:

vdb-config -i

One particular concern is the location of the cache. Put this on a disk that is large and fast.


Key other packages used are:

https://anaconda.org/bioconda/sra-tools -- SRA toolkit
